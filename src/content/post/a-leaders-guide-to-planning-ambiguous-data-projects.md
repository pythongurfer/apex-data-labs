In the world of data, one of the most common and challenging requests a leader can receive is a simple, yet profoundly ambiguous one. For me, that request came in the form of four simple words: "Improve the Product Health Dashboard."

This dashboard was supposed to be our company’s mission control, the single source of truth for the health of our entire marketplace. **In reality, it was a tool few people trusted and even fewer used.** It was slow, unreliable, and often the last to know when something was wrong.

This is the story of how we transformed that failing tool into an indispensable asset. More importantly, it’s a blueprint for how to approach any multi-quarter data project shrouded in ambiguity, and a guide to proactively uncovering what your business stakeholders really need, even when they don’t know how to ask for it.

## The Framework for Taming Ambiguity

Before diving into the story, it’s important to have a framework. When faced with a vague, long-term project, I don't create a rigid 12-month plan. Instead, I use a phased approach designed to systematically turn ambiguity into clarity and value.

**Phase 1:** Discovery & De-risking (The First Month): This phase is not about building; it's about listening and diagnosing. The goal is to deeply understand the human problem behind the technical request and to de-risk the project by validating assumptions.

**Phase 2:** Building the Foundation & Delivering an MVP (Quarter 1):The goal here is to tackle the biggest pain point and deliver a tangible win—a Minimum Viable Product—to build momentum and stakeholder trust.

**Phase 3:**Scaling & Iterating (Quarter 2 and Beyond): With a solid foundation and user feedback, this phase is about expanding the solution's impact and delivering continuous value.

This framework was our guide as we embarked on the dashboard project.

### Phase 1 in Action: Proactive Discovery and Defining the REAL Problem

The initial request was to "improve the dashboard," but **my first step was to completely ignore the dashboard itself.** I knew the low adoption wasn't a technical problem at its core; it was a human one. To understand it, I applied the principles of the **[Jobs to be Done (JTBD) framework](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done)**. I needed to uncover what "job" my stakeholders were "hiring" the dashboard to do for them.

I began a "listening tour," conducting open-ended interviews with a diverse group of stakeholders. I didn’t ask, "What new charts do you want?" I asked diagnostic questions about their work and their pain points:

- "Walk me through what happened the last time a key metric dropped."
- "Tell me about a time you felt you were flying blind when making a decision."

The stories they told were incredibly revealing. They weren’t asking for new features; they were describing deep, systemic problems.

The Head of Product told me, *"My PMs are paid to innovate, but they're spending their days as data detectives. **Every hour they spend chasing down a data discrepancy is an hour they aren't talking to customers."***

**The Unstated Need:** Not just more data, but **reliable, easily segmentable data to diagnose problems quickly.**

The Head of Operations used a powerful analogy: *"Our operational playbook is 'wait for the fire alarm, then run.' This dashboard is supposed to be the smoke detector, but **the building is already on fire by the time it goes off."***

**The Unstated Need:** Not just historical reports, but **proactive, real-time alerting to prevent crises.**

Finally, a Country Manager explained, *"I go into our quarterly business review and have to put an asterisk next to every number from t*

### Phase 2 in Action: Building Trust with a Minimum Viable Product

With a clear mission, our plan for the first quarter was focused on tackling the single biggest barrier: trust.

We knew that no one would use the dashboard, no matter how many features it had, if they didn't believe the numbers. So, our MVP was centered on reliability.  **[The Lean Startup (MVP)](https://leanstartup.co/resources/articles/what-is-an-mvp)** . Our primary goal was to stabilize the underlying data pipelines and reduce data latency from hours to under 20 minutes. We also delivered one high-value "quick win" based on my interviews: a simple filter that allowed PMs to segment data by app version, a major pain point they had described.

The result at the end of Q1 wasn't a revolutionary new dashboard. It was a dashboard that was finally fast and accurate. For the first time in a year, stakeholders started using it again. We had built a solid foundation and, more importantly, we had earned the momentum and political capital needed to continue.

### Phase 3 in Action: Scaling Iteratively Based on Feedback

With trust established, our planning for the subsequent quarters shifted. It was no longer based on my initial assumptions but on a continuous feedback loop with our now-engaged users.

- **For Q2:** Based on the Ops team's feedback, we built out the proactive alerting system they so desperately needed.  
- **For Q3:** We worked with the Monetization team to integrate new data sources that helped them track revenue-critical funnels.

This iterative approach ensured that every new feature we added was directly tied to a validated user need. The project evolved from a single, ambiguous request into a living, breathing program that delivered continuous value across the organization.

### Conclusion: Leadership in Data is About Solving Human Problems

Planning a multi-quarter, ambiguous data project can feel daunting, but this story reveals a clear path:

- **Plan by De-risking:** Start by assuming you don't know the real problem. Dedicate time to discovery to turn ambiguity into a clear, validated plan.  
- **Uncover Needs by Listening for Pain:** The most valuable insights don't come from asking people what they want. They come from understanding their problems, their workflows, and their frustrations.  

Ultimately, the most successful data projects aren't just about sophisticated technology or complex queries. They are born from a deep, empathetic understanding of the human problems we are trying to solve.
