## Project Goals & Success Criteria

To secure stakeholder buy-in and ensure alignment, we defined a clear set of measurable goals across three domains:

| Domain      | Goal                                                                                             | Key Metric(s)                                   | Target      |

## Chapter 1: The Problem Space - Why Simple Ranking Fails at Scale'

## Introduction: The Core Dilemma of a Marketplace

In any large-scale digital marketplace, a fundamental tension defines the search experience: the conflict between **user-centric relevance** and **business-centric monetization**. For our platform, the ultimate measure of success is **liquidity**—the efficiency and frequency with which we connect buyers to sellers. This is best measured by the **rate of buyer-to-seller contacts**. On the other hand, a sustainable business model requires a monetization layer, which for us involves sellers purchasing Value-Added Services (VAS) to boost their ads.

Our starting point was a classic reflection of this dilemma. Our search engine, built on a robust SolrCloud cluster serving over **500 million queries per day** across **30+ countries**, was effective at text matching, but our monetization strategy was a blunt instrument: the **top four search results were fixed slots reserved for sponsored ads**.

A key challenge was that user behavior and price sensitivity vary dramatically between markets like Brazil, Poland, and India. A one-size-fits-all model was not an option. Our architecture needed to support **market-specific models** from day one. Furthermore, the extreme heterogeneity of our catalog—from high-value items like cars to low-value items like used books—meant that features like `price` had to be normalized logarithmically and considered within their category context to be effective.

This simple approach, while generating predictable revenue, was creating significant friction in our ecosystem:
* **Degraded User Experience:** For high-intent searches, users were forced to scroll past potentially irrelevant ads to find the perfect organic item, hindering a quick and successful connection.
* **Cannibalization of Liquidity:** The best organic result was often pushed below the fold, decreasing its visibility and depressing the overall contact rate, our North Star metric.
* **Inefficiency for Sellers:** Advertisers paid for a premium position, but if their ad was not contextually relevant, they received few contacts, leading to a low return on investment and seller churn.

We knew our platform's long-term health depended on resolving this conflict. Our vision was to dismantle this rigid system and build a **unified, intelligent ranking ecosystem**—one capable of making nuanced, data-driven decisions to maximize both marketplace liquidity and revenue simultaneously.

This article is the detailed technical story of how we achieved this. It's a step-by-step journey from the initial problem definition to the implementation of a **multi-objective Learning to Rank (LTR) solution** with Solr and LambdaMART, covering the data, the model, the architecture, and the critical monitoring framework that ensures its success.

## Chapter 1: The Problem Space - Why Simple Ranking Fails at Scale

Before architecting a solution, we needed to deeply understand and quantify the problem.

### The Initial Architecture: Simple but Flawed

Our v1 system was a straightforward two-step process:
1.  A user's query would hit our backend search service.
2.  The service would send the query to a **SolrCloud cluster**. Solr would execute the search, returning a list of organic results ranked by its default similarity algorithm, **BM25**.
3.  Concurrently, the backend would call a separate Ads Service to retrieve up to four sponsored items.
4.  Finally, the backend would perform a crude stitching operation: placing the four ads at the top, followed by the organic results from Solr.



### Quantifying the Pain: The Data-Driven Case for Change

Intuition told us this was a poor experience, but to justify a major engineering investment, we needed data. A series of analyses and A/B tests painted a clear picture:
* Queries with the full four-ad banner had a **12% lower overall contact rate** compared to purely organic search results.
* The **session abandonment rate**—where a user performs a single search and then leaves the site—was **8% higher**, indicating user frustration.
* The system was fundamentally misaligned. We were optimizing for ad impressions, not for our North Star metric: **successful connections**.

### The Business Case: Establishing a New North Star

With this data, we formulated a clear business case. The goal was not to eliminate monetization but to integrate it intelligently. Our strategic objective was defined as:

> **Increase revenue per search by 15% while simultaneously increasing our North Star metric, the buyer-to-seller contact rate, by 5% or more.**

This gave us a clear, measurable goal that aligned the interests of our buyers, our sellers, and our business.

## Chapter 2: The Foundation of Learning - Building the Training Dataset

The heart of any machine learning system is the data it learns from. Our first and most critical task was to construct a massive, high-quality dataset that would teach our model what a "good" ranking looks like from our new, unified perspective.

### Step 2.1: The Data - Indexing Features in Solr and the Feature Store

Our data pipelines, built using Apache Spark on AWS EMR, processed and joined information from multiple sources: search logs, user interaction data, seller data, and monetization logs. The output is a rich set of features available for every single ad in our catalog.

Below is a simplified visualization of how this feature data might look in our Feature Store (e.g., Redis or DynamoDB) at indexing time. This is the "raw material" our system works with.

**Visualization: Feature Data for Indexed Ads**

<div class="table-container">
  <p><strong>Visualization: Feature Data for Indexed Ads</strong></p>
  <table class="data-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>doc_id</th>
        <th>seller_id</th>
        <th>bm_score</th>
        <th>price</th>
        <th>seller_rating</th>
        <th>img_score</th>
        <th>fav_rate</th>
        <th>ctr_7d</th>
        <th class="highlight-user">contact_rate</th>
        <th>is_sponsored</th>
        <th class="highlight-biz">vas_value</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>AD-101</td>
        <td>S-A</td>
        <td>25.4</td>
        <td>1900</td>
        <td>4.9</td>
        <td>0.95</td>
        <td>0.082</td>
        <td>0.451</td>
        <td class="highlight-user"><strong>0.153</strong></td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td class="highlight-biz">0.0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>AD-102</td>
        <td>S-B</td>
        <td>22.1</td>
        <td>1950</td>
        <td>4.7</td>
        <td>0.88</td>
        <td>0.051</td>
        <td>0.310</td>
        <td class="highlight-user"><strong>0.080</strong></td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td class="highlight-biz">15.0</td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
  </table>
  <p class="table-caption">
    <em>This is the table caption...</em>
  </p>
</div>

*This table represents the rich feature set available for each ad. I've **bolded** our North Star metric (`contact_rate`) and our key monetization feature (`vas_value`) as these are the two signals our model must learn to balance. After training, a feature importance analysis (e.g., using SHAP values) revealed that `seller_rating`, the 7-day `ctr_7d`, and the historical `contact_rate` were the most powerful predictors of user relevance, while `vas_value` was, as expected, the primary driver for monetization. Abbreviations used: `img_score` (image_quality_score), `fav_rate` (favorite_rate).*

*This table represents the rich feature set available for each ad. Note that metrics like CTR and contact rate are frequencies (e.g., `contact_rate = contacts / impressions`), not absolute numbers. This data provides the signals for both relevance and business value.*

### Step 2.2: The Objective - Defining the Prediction Target

This was the most critical conceptual step. If we simply trained the model to predict the historical `contact_rate`, it would learn to ignore sponsored ads. To teach it to blend, we had to create a new, unified target variable—the `objective_label`—that represented our combined business strategy.

Our logic was to create a new target that rewarded both successful user connections and successful monetization events. For this, we analyzed historical data where we knew the outcome of a search.

The visualization below shows the data we prepared for the **re-ranking model**. This is the "textbook" from which our LambdaMART model will learn.

**Visualization: Training Data for the Re-ranking Model**
<div class="table-container">
  <table class="data-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th><code>query_id</code></th>
        <th><code>doc_id</code></th>
        <th><code>relevance_label</code><br><small>(based on historical <code>contact_rate</code>)</small></th>
        <th><code>vas_value</code></th>
        <th>Logic for Blending</th>
        <th><code>objective_label</code><br><small>(THE GOAL)</small></th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>q_101</td>
        <td>AD-101</td>
        <td style="text-align: center;"><strong>3 (High)</strong></td>
        <td style="text-align: right;">0.0</td>
        <td>Organic: Value is its relevance.</td>
        <td style="text-align: center;"><strong>3.0</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>q_101</td>
        <td>AD-102</td>
        <td style="text-align: center;"><strong>2 (Mid)</strong></td>
        <td class="highlight-biz" style="text-align: right;">15.0</td>
        <td>Sponsored & Successful: Value = Relevance + Bonus.</td>
        <td style="text-align: center;"><strong>3.5</strong> (2.0 + 1.5)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>q_101</td>
        <td>AD-104</td>
        <td style="text-align: center;"><strong>0 (Low)</strong></td>
        <td class="highlight-biz" style="text-align: right;">5.0</td>
        <td>Sponsored & Unsuccessful: Value = Relevance.</td>
        <td style="text-align: center;"><strong>0.0</strong></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

*This table illustrates the core of our multi-objective strategy. We created a new `objective_label` that explicitly teaches the model that a **relevant, successful sponsored ad (AD-102) can be more valuable to the entire ecosystem than even a highly relevant organic ad (AD-101).** This is how the model learns to blend.*

### Step 2.3: The Learning Algorithm - Training LambdaMART

With our feature-rich dataset and strategically designed objective label, it was time to train the ranking model. We chose **LambdaMART** because it is a state-of-the-art algorithm specifically designed for ranking problems and is excellent at modeling complex, non-linear interactions between features.

* **Tools:** We used Python and the `lightgbm` library on SageMaker. The LambdaMART model was tuned using Bayesian optimization on SageMaker. Key hyperparameters we focused on were `num_leaves`, `learning_rate`, and `min_child_samples` to balance model complexity and prevent overfitting.
* **Process:** The LambdaMART algorithm iteratively builds an ensemble of decision trees. In each step, it adjusts its internal structure to maximize the **NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)** score, calculated against our new `objective_label`.
* **Result:** The final output is a single, serialized model file (`model.bst`). This file is the "brain" of our ranking system, containing the complex logic for scoring any ad for any query.

## Chapter 3: Production Architecture - Serving Rankings at Scale on AWS

A trained model is useless without a robust, low-latency architecture to serve it. We designed a microservices-based system on AWS to handle real-time inference.



**The Real-Time Inference Flow (sub-200ms):**

1.  **Request:** A user's search request hits our **API Gateway** and is routed to a load balancer in our **Kubernetes (EKS) cluster**.
2.  **Search Service:** The request is picked up by a pod running our Search Service.
3.  **Phase 1 - Candidate Retrieval:** The service makes a call to our **SolrCloud cluster**. Solr uses BM25 to find the top 200 candidates and returns their IDs along with their text-relevance features.
4.  **Phase 2 - Feature Enrichment:** This is a performance-critical step. The service orchestrates a series of parallel, non-blocking calls to enrich the 200 candidates with the full set of features from our **Feature Store (ElastiCache for Redis and DynamoDB)**.
5.  **Phase 3 - Re-ranking:** The 200 complete feature vectors are sent to our trained LambdaMART model, served via an **AWS SageMaker endpoint**.
6.  **Phase 4 - Sorting & Response:** SageMaker returns 200 numerical scores. The Search Service performs a simple sort on these scores and returns the final, intelligently ranked list to the user.

The mathematical function applied by the model to each feature vector `x_d` is the sum of the predictions from all `T` trees in the ensemble:

$$S_d = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \alpha \cdot h_t(x_d)$$

Where $S_d$ is the final score for the document $d$, $\alpha$ is the learning rate, and $h_t(x_d)$ is the prediction of the individual tree $t$ for the feature vector $x_d$.

## Chapter 4: Operational Excellence - Monitoring and Observability

Deploying a machine learning model into a critical path like search requires a deep commitment to monitoring. Instead of complex code, let's visualize what our operational dashboard in Grafana looks like. This dashboard is our real-time view into the health of the entire system.

**Visualization: Live System Health Dashboard (Grafana)**
| Metric Name | Current Value | Target / Threshold | Trend (1h) |
|:---|:---:|:---|:---:|
| **[North Star] Contact Rate per Search** | 0.185 | > 0.180 | 📈 (Up) |
| **[Business] Revenue per Search (€)** | 0.042 | > 0.040 | 📈 (Up) |
| **[User Exp.] Offline NDCG (Sampled)**| 0.89 | > 0.88 | 📉 (Down) |
| **[Ops] p99 Search Latency (ms)** | 185ms | < 200ms | ✅ (Stable) |
| **[Ops] API Error Rate (%)** | 0.05% | < 0.1% | ✅ (Stable) |
| **[Ops] SageMaker p95 Latency (ms)**| 45ms | < 50ms | ✅ (Stable) |

*This dashboard provides an at-a-glance view for both product managers and engineers. We have alerts configured in Alertmanager (part of the Prometheus ecosystem) that trigger if any of these metrics breach their thresholds. We also established critical **guardrail metrics** to prevent unintended consequences, including **seller churn rate** (to ensure we weren't angering non-paying sellers), **zero-result search rate**, and **result diversity** (to avoid over-promoting a small set of popular items).*

---

## Chapter 5: The Broader Search Ecosystem

A great ranking algorithm is the core, but a world-class search experience is an ecosystem of features working in harmony.

* **Solr Customization:** While our heavy re-ranking logic moved to LTR, Solr remains a powerful, extensible platform. We have developed **custom Java Search Components and Query Parsers** to handle business-specific logic during the candidate retrieval phase. For example, a component can apply hard filters (like location) or boost certain categories before the results are even sent to the LTR model, making the entire process more efficient.

* **Popular Searches & Bias:** A "Popular Searches" feature is an easy win for engagement. However, it must be used with caution as it creates a **popularity feedback loop**, where already popular items or queries become even more dominant, hiding the "long tail" of the catalog. We mitigate this by blending popular searches with personalized suggestions.

* **The Holy Trinity of Query Assistance:** To reduce friction, the core ranking engine must be supported by:
    * **Autosuggest/Autocomplete:** Suggests complete queries as the user types.
    * **Autocorrect/Spell-Correction:** Fixes typos to prevent zero-result searches.
    * **Semantic Search:** This is the next frontier. We are actively working on generating vector embeddings for our entire catalog using models like S-BERT. By implementing an Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search index, we can understand the *meaning* of a query, not just its keywords.

## Chapter 6: The Vision - Roadmap and the Saturation of Gains

### Business Value Unleashed

The implementation of this multi-objective ranking system was a watershed moment for our platform. It moved search from a blunt utility to a sophisticated optimization engine. The results were dramatic:
* We **increased our North Star metric, the contact rate, by 7% (from a baseline of 0.172 to 0.185)**.
* We simultaneously **increased overall revenue per search by 22% (from €0.034 to €0.042)** by showing more relevant ads more effectively.
* We significantly **increased seller satisfaction**, as their advertising budget was now being spent far more efficiently.

### The Law of Diminishing Returns

It's critical to acknowledge the **saturation of improvement**. The initial leap from a rules-based system to a mature LTR model yields massive gains. Subsequent improvements become incremental. This is when the strategic focus must shift from revolutionary projects to continuous optimization.

### Our Future Roadmap

Our roadmap reflects this shift, moving from foundational improvements to next-generation capabilities.

* **Horizon 1 (Continuous Optimization):**
    * **Automated Re-training Pipelines:** Building a full MLOps pipeline to automatically re-train, validate, and deploy new models weekly.
    * **Feature A/B Testing Framework:** A robust system to continuously experiment with new features and measure their marginal impact.

* **Horizon 2 (Semantic Understanding):**
    * **Full Rollout of Vector Search:** Integrate our semantic search capabilities to handle zero-result queries and improve discovery for long-tail needs.
    * **Personalized Ranking:** Incorporate real-time user embeddings into the LTR model to make rankings personalized for each individual user's current intent.

* **Horizon 3 (Dynamic Optimization):**
    * **Explore Reinforcement Learning:** Investigate models that can dynamically adjust the strategic weights between liquidity and monetization in real time based on market conditions, inventory levels, or even the time of day, moving from a fixed strategy to a fully adaptive one.

## Conclusion

The journey from a fixed-slot ad system to a dynamic, multi-objective ranking engine is far more than a technical upgrade—it's a fundamental shift in product and business strategy. It requires a deep alignment across teams and a commitment to data-driven decision-making. By building a unified system that learns from data, we not only resolved the conflict between marketplace liquidity and monetization but also created a powerful, sustainable competitive advantage and a core engine for the future growth of our marketplace.
