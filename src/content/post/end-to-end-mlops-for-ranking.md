## Introduction: From One-Off Model to Automated Engine

In our high-level case study, we discussed replacing a fixed-slot ad system with a multi-objective Learning to Rank (LTR) model. The strategic "what" and "why" are clear, but the true challenge in modern machine learning is the operational "how."

A successful model is not a one-time project; it's a living product. It requires a robust, automated, and observable ecosystem to manage its entire lifecycle. This article is the detailed MLOps blueprint for our LambdaMART ranking model. We will cover every step, from raw data ingestion to real-time production monitoring, providing the technical details for ML engineers and MLOps professionals.

### The MLOps Framework: A High-Level View

Our philosophy is to build an automated system that enables continuous improvement. The architecture is built on a combination of open-source tools and managed AWS services, forming a cohesive MLOps pipeline.

![MLOps Lifecycle Diagram](...) <!-- A diagram showing the flow described below -->

1.  **Data Lake (S3):** Raw logs and batch data are stored.
2.  **Feature Factory (Spark on EMR):** Batch jobs process raw data into features.
3.  **Feature Store (Redis & DynamoDB):** Features are stored for low-latency access.
4.  **Model Training & Registry (SageMaker & MLflow):** Models are trained, versioned, and registered.
5.  **Deployment (SageMaker Endpoints):** Registered models are deployed to production.
6.  **Monitoring (Prometheus & Grafana):** Model and system performance are tracked in real-time.

## Chapter 1: The Feature Factory - Powering the Model with Data

High-quality features are the lifeblood of any ML model. Our "Feature Factory" is a set of automated Spark jobs running on AWS EMR that transform raw data into predictive signals.

### Data Sources and Ingestion
*   **Search & Click Logs:** Ingested in real-time via Kafka and archived to a "raw" S3 bucket.
*   **Seller & Ad Data:** Captured via Change Data Capture (CDC) from our primary RDS databases and streamed to S3.
*   **Monetization Data:** Batch exports from our billing systems.

### Feature Engineering with Spark

Hourly Spark jobs run on EMR to compute and aggregate features.

*   **User-Item Interaction Features:** These capture relevance signals.
    *   *Example:* Calculating the 7-day click-through rate (`ctr_7d`) for each ad.
    ```sql
    -- Simplified Spark SQL
    SELECT
        ad_id,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'click' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'impression' THEN 1 END) AS ctr_7d
    FROM clickstream_logs
    WHERE event_date >= date_sub(current_date, 7)
    GROUP BY ad_id
    ```
*   **Item-Level Features:** Static attributes of the ad.
    *   `days_since_creation`, `price_deviation_from_category_mean`, `image_quality_score` (output from a separate computer vision model).
*   **Seller-Level Features:** Historical performance of the seller.
    *   `seller_avg_contact_rate`, `seller_item_count`.

### The Feature Store: Bridging Batch and Real-Time

Once features are computed, they need to be available for both training and real-time inference. This is the role of the Feature Store.

*   **Offline Store (S3):** The full historical feature dataset is stored in Parquet format on S3. This is used for model training.
*   **Online Store (Redis & DynamoDB):** The latest feature values for every ad are pushed to a low-latency online store.
    *   **Redis (ElastiCache):** Used for frequently accessed, fast-changing features like CTRs.
    *   **DynamoDB:** Used for less frequently updated features like seller-level stats.

This dual-store approach provides the scale needed for training and the speed needed for production inference.

## Chapter 2: The Model Lifecycle - Training, Versioning, and Deployment

This is the core of the MLOps pipeline, where a model is born, validated, and pushed to production.

### Step 2.1: Automated Training with SageMaker

A weekly scheduled job kicks off the training process using an **AWS Step Function**.

1.  **Data Prep:** The Step Function launches a SageMaker Processing job that pulls the latest features from the offline Feature Store (S3) and constructs the `objective_label` as described in our previous article.
2.  **Training:** It then launches a SageMaker Training job. We use the built-in LightGBM container.
    *   **MLflow Integration:** The training script is instrumented with MLflow. It logs hyperparameters, evaluation metrics (like NDCG@10), and the final trained model artifact (`model.bst`) to our central **MLflow Tracking Server**.
    ```python
    # Simplified training script snippet
    import lightgbm as lgb
    import mlflow

    with mlflow.start_run():
        # Log hyperparameters
        mlflow.log_params(params)

        # Train the model
        ranker = lgb.train(params, train_data, valid_sets=[test_data])
        
        # Log metrics
        ndcg_score = calculate_ndcg(ranker, test_data)
        mlflow.log_metric("ndcg_at_10", ndcg_score)

        # Log the model artifact to MLflow
        mlflow.lightgbm.log_model(ranker, "model")
    ```

### Step 2.2: The Model Registry - Our Single Source of Truth

MLflow is the cornerstone of our model governance.

*   **Model Versioning:** Each training run creates a new model artifact. When a model meets our quality threshold (e.g., `ndcg_at_10 > 0.88`), it is promoted and registered in the **MLflow Model Registry**. This gives us a versioned history (e.g., `ranking-model:v23`).
*   **Staging and Production:** The registry uses "stages." A new model is first promoted to `Staging`. After successful tests, it can be promoted to `Production`.

### Step 2.3: Automated Deployment to Staging and Production

Our Step Function workflow continues after a model is registered in MLflow.

1.  **Deploy to Staging:** The workflow automatically triggers a deployment pipeline (e.g., Jenkins or CodePipeline) that takes the model version marked as `Staging` from MLflow and deploys it to a dedicated **SageMaker Staging Endpoint**.
2.  **Automated A/B Testing:** For 24 hours, a small percentage of production traffic (e.g., 5%) is routed to the staging model. We closely monitor its performance against the current production model on key business metrics (contact rate, revenue).
3.  **Promote to Production:** If the staging model shows a significant improvement and no negative impact on guardrail metrics, a product manager can approve its promotion. The model's stage in MLflow is changed to `Production`.
4.  **Blue/Green Deployment:** The deployment pipeline then updates the **Production SageMaker Endpoint**, gradually shifting 100% of traffic to the new model version with zero downtime.

## Chapter 3: Observability - If You Can't See It, You Can't Trust It

A model in production is a source of business risk if not properly monitored. Our observability stack is built on Prometheus and Grafana.

### Key Dashboards

We have several Grafana dashboards tailored to different audiences:

*   **Business Health Dashboard:**
    *   **Metrics:** Real-time Contact Rate, Revenue per Search, Ad CTR.
    *   **Audience:** Product Managers. This shows the business impact.
*   **Model Performance Dashboard:**
    *   **Metrics:** Offline vs. Online NDCG (to detect data drift), feature distribution drift, prediction latency.
    *   **Audience:** Data Scientists. This shows if the model is behaving as expected.
*   **System Health Dashboard:**
    *   **Metrics:** SageMaker Endpoint p99 latency, CPU/Memory utilization, error rates (4xx/5xx).
    *   **Audience:** MLOps/Engineers. This shows the health of the infrastructure.

### Alerting

We use **Prometheus Alertmanager** to define critical alerts.
*   `P1 Alert (Wakes someone up at 3 AM)`: A significant drop in revenue per search or a spike in SageMaker 5xx errors.
*   `P2 Alert (Creates a ticket)`: A gradual drift in the distribution of a key feature, suggesting the model may need retraining sooner than scheduled.

## Conclusion: Building the Machine That Builds the Model

Implementing a Learning to Rank model is a powerful intervention. However, the true long-term value is unlocked by building a robust, automated MLOps ecosystem around it. This "machine that builds the machine" allows for rapid experimentation, safe and reliable deployments, and deep observability into the model's impact on the business.

This blueprint—combining a Spark-based feature factory, a governed MLflow registry, and automated SageMaker deployment pipelines—is our solution for turning a promising model into a sustainable, revenue-driving engine at the heart of our marketplace.
