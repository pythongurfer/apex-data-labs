The previous analysis deconstructed a single neuron—a stateless function approximator. Such a model is fundamentally incapable of understanding sequence or context, which is the essence of language. To predict the next word in a sentence, a network must possess **memory**. This requires an evolution in architecture from simple feed-forward networks to **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**.

This article details the theory and mathematics behind modeling sequential data, explains the critical role of different activation functions, and builds up to the **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** cell, an architecture explicitly designed to handle long-range dependencies and capture semantic context.

### The Limitation of Stateless Models

A feed-forward neuron computes its output based solely on the current input ($x$). If you show it the word "on" in the sequence "The cat sat on...", it has no access to the preceding words. It cannot know that "mat" is a more probable next word than "Mars". To solve this, the network needs a mechanism to carry information from one step to the next.

### Introducing State: The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

An RNN introduces a **hidden state**, denoted $h_t$, which acts as the network's memory. At each timestep $t$, the hidden state is a function of both the current input $x_t$ and the *previous* hidden state $h_{t-1}$.



The core recurrence relation is:
$$ h_t = f(W_{hh}h_{t-1} + W_{xh}x_t + b_h) $$
Here, $f$ is a non-linear activation function, typically the **hyperbolic tangent (tanh)**. The network maintains two sets of weights: $W_{hh}$ for the connection from the previous hidden state, and $W_{xh}$ for the connection from the current input.

The output prediction $\hat{y}_t$ is then typically a linear transformation of the hidden state:
$$ \hat{y}_t = W_{hy}h_t + b_y $$
This output $\hat{y}_t$ is a vector of raw scores (logits) for every word in the vocabulary.

#### The Problem: Vanishing and Exploding Gradients

In theory, the hidden state $h_t$ captures information from all previous timesteps. In practice, simple RNNs have a short-term memory. During training (using an algorithm called Backpropagation Through Time), the gradient signal from an error must travel backward through the network. As it is repeatedly multiplied by the weight matrix $W_{hh}$, it can either shrink exponentially to zero (**vanishing gradient**) or grow exponentially (**exploding gradient**). This makes it nearly impossible for the network to learn dependencies between words that are far apart in a sequence.

### The Solution: Gated Cells for Long-Range Memory (LSTM)

The **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** network, a specialized type of RNN, was designed to solve this problem. It introduces a separate **cell state** ($C_t$) that acts as a long-term memory "conveyor belt." Information can be added to or removed from this cell state via a series of **gates**—neural networks in their own right that regulate information flow.

An LSTM cell at timestep $t$ performs the following operations:



1.  **Forget Gate ($f_t$)**: Decides what information from the previous cell state $C_{t-1}$ should be discarded. It uses a **Sigmoid** activation to output a number between 0 (completely forget) and 1 (completely keep) for each element in the cell state.
    $$ f_t = \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f) $$
2.  **Input Gate ($i_t$) and Candidate Memory ($\tilde{C}_t$)**: Together, these decide what new information to store.
    * The **Input Gate** (Sigmoid) determines which values to update.
        $$ i_t = \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i) $$
    * A **tanh** layer creates a vector of new candidate values, $\tilde{C}_t$, that could be added to the state.
        $$ \tilde{C}_t = \tanh(W_C \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C) $$
3.  **Update Cell State**: The old cell state is updated to the new cell state $C_t$ by first multiplying it by the forget gate's output, and then adding the new candidate information from the input gate.
    $$ C_t = f_t \odot C_{t-1} + i_t \odot \tilde{C}_t $$
    Here, $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication.

4.  **Output Gate ($o_t$)**: Decides what the next hidden state $h_t$ (the short-term memory and output for this step) should be.
    $$ o_t = \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o) $$
    $$ h_t = o_t \odot \tanh(C_t) $$

### A Taxonomy of Activation Functions

The LSTM architecture highlights how different activation functions are chosen for specialized roles based on their mathematical properties.

* **Sigmoid ($\sigma$)**: The **Gate Controller**. Its output range of $(0, 1)$ makes it the perfect choice for gating mechanisms. It answers the question "How much of this information should pass through?" A value of 0.9 means "pass 90%," while 0.1 means "pass 10%."

* **Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh)**: The **Content Modulator**. Its output range of $(-1, 1)$ is zero-centered, which is beneficial for learning dynamics. It is used to create the new candidate memory $\tilde{C}_t$, deciding whether to positively or negatively weight a piece of information before it's potentially added to the cell state.

* **Softmax**: The **Probability Distributor**. This function is used only at the very final layer of a language model. It takes the vector of raw output scores ($\hat{y}_t$) and transforms it into a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary, where all values are in $(0, 1)$ and sum to 1.
    $$ \text{Softmax}(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{z_j}} \quad \text{for } i=1, \dots, K $$
    The word with the highest probability is the model's prediction for the next word.

* **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: The **Default Choice for Deep Networks**. While not central to this classic LSTM design, ReLU ($f(x) = \max(0, x)$) and its variants (Leaky ReLU, etc.) are the standard activation for most other deep learning architectures (like Transformers and CNNs). Its primary advantages are computational efficiency and its ability to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem in very deep feed-forward layers.

### From Prediction to Semantics

The "semantic understanding" of the model is not an abstract concept; it is physically encoded in the **hidden state vector $h_t$**. After processing the sequence "The cat sat on the...", the vector $h_t$ is a dense, numerical representation—an **embedding**—of that entire context. This vector contains the information that the subject is an animal, the action is sitting, and a location is expected. This contextual embedding is what allows the Softmax layer to assign a high probability to "mat" or "couch" and a near-zero probability to "election" or "galaxy." The LSTM's gating mechanism allows this vector to maintain relevant context over long distances, forming the basis of its semantic capability.
